# Bathymetric-Echosounder
Development of an inexpensive echosounder for bathymetry measurements in coastal waters

The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost bathymetric echosounder array for use in the nearshore through storm events.
Current strategy involves using off-the-shelf ultrasonic transducers modified to operate underwater.
